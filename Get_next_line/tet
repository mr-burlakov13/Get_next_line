The project get_next_line is straightforward and leaves very little room for bonuses,
but I am sure that you have a lot of imagination. If you aced perfectly the mandatory
part, then by all means complete this bonus part to go further. I repeat, no bonus will
be taken into consideration if the mandatory part isnâ€™t perfect.
Turn-in all 3 initial files with _bonus for this part.
//int main()
//{
//    char *line;
//    int fd;

//    fd = open("tet", O_RDONLY);

//    {
//        printf( "%d %s\n", i, line);
//    if (line != NULL)
//        free(line);
